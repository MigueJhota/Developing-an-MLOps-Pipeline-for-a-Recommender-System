    "\n",
    "Pandas is a Python library that provides flexible date structures and date analysis tools. \n",
    "Importing it as pd is a common convention to shorten the library name and make the code more consice. \n",
    "Pandas is widely used to manipulate and analyze tabular datasets.\n",

    "JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight, human-readable data interchange format.\n",
    "The json library in Python allows for the serialization and deserialization of data in JSON format.\n",

    "**AST (import ast):**\n",
    "\n",
    "AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) is a hierarchical representation of the syntactic structure of a Python program.\n",

    "**Warnings (import warnings):**\n",
    "\n",
    "The warnings module provides tools for controlling the warnings emitted by Python.\n",
    "In this case, it's being configured to ignore warnings, which can be useful to prevent warnings from filling up the console output and distracting during code execution.\n",
    "In summary, these imports are common in data analysis and date science environments in Python, providing tools for manipulating data, working with JSON, parsing regular expressions, and handling warnings.\n",
